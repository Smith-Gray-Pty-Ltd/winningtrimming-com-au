# template-website — Agent Context

> Auto-generated from `.usm/system.usm`. Hand-edit sections below; they'll be preserved on regeneration.

template-website — system description. Edit this to describe what the system does in 1-3 sentences.

## Rules for Agents

1. **Read the relevant .usm files before modifying any code.** Use MCP tools (`usm_list`, `usm_read`, `usm_search`) to understand the system map.
2. **Follow patterns established in shared packages.** Do not invent new auth patterns.
3. **Conventional commits**: `feat(scope): description`, `fix(scope): description`.
4. **Never stop a running dev server.**
5. **Never commit without passing lint AND typecheck.**

## USM Spec-First Workflow

This project uses USM for structured system documentation. Follow this workflow:

### Before Starting Work
0. **Confirm the docs watch server is running** (`usm docs serve --watch`).
   If not running, start it. The human reviews specs in the browser, not just chat.
1. Use MCP tools to read the system map:
   - `usm_list` — list all .usm files
   - `usm_read` — read a specific feature or service
   - `usm_search` — find features by keyword
   - `usm_summary` — quick overview of a file

### When Implementing a New Feature
1. Discuss the feature with the human
2. Call `usm_draft_feature` with structured fields (summary, intent, flows, contracts, tests)
3. Show the human the generated markdown preview for review
4. If approved, call `usm_write_feature` to persist the .usm file
5. **Return the live docs link** (e.g. `http://localhost:5173/features/...`) so the human can review the rendered spec in the browser
6. Wait for human confirmation that the spec is correct before implementing
7. Implement the feature in code
8. Call `usm_update_feature_status` to mark as built (with implementation path)

### When Updating an Existing Feature
1. Read the existing .usm spec first (`usm_read`)
2. Make code changes
3. Call `usm_update_feature` if the spec needs updating
4. Call `usm_update_feature_status` if status changed
5. **Return the live docs link** so the human can verify the updated spec renders correctly

### Generating and Reviewing Docs
- `usm docs serve --watch` — serve docs locally with VitePress, watch .usm/ for changes
- `usm docs serve --audience help` — serve filtered public docs
- `usm generate` — produce markdown, OpenAPI, Mermaid, test specs from .usm files

### Key Rules
- **NEVER** create .usm files by hand — use the MCP write tools (they validate)
- **ALWAYS** show the human the markdown before writing to disk
- **ALWAYS** return the live docs link after writing a spec — the human reviews in the browser
- **ALWAYS** wait for human confirmation before implementing
- **ALWAYS** update feature status after implementation
- The .usm file IS the documentation — if it's wrong, the docs are wrong

## Agent Feedback Protocol

> **If you are an AI agent, read this.** When you discover a bug, inconsistency, or improvement, first classify WHERE it lives (below), then follow this project's configured policy — do NOT improvise or invent your own tracking files.

### Step 1 — Where does the bug live?

| Scope | Covers | Where it goes |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| **This project** | App code, infra, this repo's own `.usm` specs | Step 2 below — this project's policy |
| **The USM tool itself** | `@smithgray/usm` CLI commands, MCP tool behaviour, generator output, schema validation | Upstream: <https://github.com/Smith-Gray-Pty-Ltd/usm/issues> |

USM tool bugs are NOT this project's bugs. Include the `@smithgray/usm` version (`npm ls @smithgray/usm`), the command or MCP tool invoked, reproduction steps, and expected vs actual.
For a USM tool bug: describe it to the human and **ask** whether to file it upstream (they may prefer to file it themselves).
**Never** file USM tool bugs in this project's tracker or in `.usm/feedback/` — they will not be seen by anyone who can fix them.

### Step 2 — This project's policy (for project-scope issues)

**Active policy:** `human-gate`

- Surface the issue to the human in conversation. Describe what you found and **ask** whether to record or file it.
- Do **NOT** write any feedback file, create an issue, or commit a fix without explicit human approval.

**Hard rules (all policies):**
- **NEVER** create ad-hoc tracking files at the repo root (`bugs.md`, `ISSUES.md`, `TODO-agent.md`, etc.).
- The **only** canonical location for structured project feedback is `.usm/feedback/`.
- Real bugs in the **USM tool itself** live upstream: <https://github.com/Smith-Gray-Pty-Ltd/usm/issues> — never in this repo.
- If ever unsure, default to asking the human.
